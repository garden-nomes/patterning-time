What you see here are two different kinds of patterns.  The first is the simple pattern used to weave this piece of fabric.  The second, more complex pattern is a set of rules that governs which the lights that turn on and off.  The state of a light at any given time is dependent upon the previous state of that light and its immediate neighbors.  The computer is tracking the history of which lights have been on and off.  This is called a one-dimensional cellular automata.

I see the passage of time as moving in similar ways.  When depression sets in or Iâ€™ve had a bit too much to smoke, time begins to look like the first pattern: a series of moments repeated endlessly.  Past events become inescapably absolute truths.  However, the truth is that time never precisely repeats itself.  Each moment is conditioned by the previous moment in an endless cascade of cause and effect, as in the second pattern, so that as long as the world is infinitely granular every moment can be an entirely unique world unto itself.  It only starts to look like the a repeated pattern when you chart out the state of the world over time.  If you look at the screen, you may start to see certain shapes and patterns that occur frequently.  Because of this we never experience a moment in time as independent of the moments that came before it.
